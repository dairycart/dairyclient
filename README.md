# Dairyclient [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dairycart/dairyclient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dairycart/dairyclient) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dairycart/dairyclient/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/dairycart/dairyclient?branch=master)
a golang client for making API requests

## Usage note

This client, and the API it is meant to connect to, are both in a pre-alpha state, where many things are likely to change. It would be foolhardy to assume that any software, should you choose to build it, would be able to rely on the presence of any currently existent field or method, at least until such time that this diclaimer disappears or is otherwise revised.
